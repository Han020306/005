## Quarto

Quarto enables you to weave together content and executable code into a finished document. To learn more about Quarto see <https://quarto.org>.

## Running Code

When you click the **Render** button a document will be generated that includes both content and the output of embedded code. You can embed code like this:

```{r}
1 + 1
```

You can add options to executable code like this

```{r}
#| echo: false
2 * 2
```

The `echo: false` option disables the printing of code (only output is displayed).

```{r}
# Load the 'sf' library, which stands for Simple Features, used for working with spatial data.
library(sf)
# Load the 'tidyverse' library, a collection of packages for data manipulation and visualization.
library(tidyverse)
# Load the 'tmap' library, which is used for creating thematic maps and visualizing spatial data.
library(tmap)
# The 'readr' library provides a fast and user-friendly way to read data from common formats like CSV.
library(readr)
# Converts Between GeoJSON and simple feature objects
library(geojsonsf) 
# RColorBrewer library for creating visually appealing color schemes for plots and data visualizations
library(RColorBrewer)
# Corking with class intervals and classification methods, esp in the context of spatial data analysis.
library(classInt)
library(readxl)
library(fs)
```

```{r}
GII <- read_excel("data/hdr-data.xlsx")
world_boundary <-st_read("data/World_Countries_Generalized.shp")
```

```{r}
GII_world <- left_join(world_boundary, 
                       GII, 
                       by=c("COUNTRY"="country"))
```

```{r}
GII_world_filtered <- GII_world %>%
  filter(indicator == "Gender Inequality Index (value)")

```
